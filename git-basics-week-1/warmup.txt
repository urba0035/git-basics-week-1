Basic warmup for VSCODE/Github workflow.

Step 1: check if you have Git:

press ctrl + j to open the terminal and type in
git --version

Step 2: initialize a repository:

type into terminal: git init 
-- there should be a "u" next to all of the files in the vscode directory, it means "untracked" --

Step 3: staging a file (to be committed):

type into terminal: git add "directory/file-name.ext"

-- tip: "git add ." to stage multiple changed files at once --

-- there should be an "a" next to the targeted file in the vscode directory, meaning the file is added to the repository --

Step 4: check the git status

type into terminal: git status
-- checks whether things were staged/committed --

Step 5: commit with a message

Type into terminal:
git commit -m "message"

-- the -m allows you to follow up the commit with a message to determine what changes were implemented --

Step 6 (GITHUB.COM): Create a repository in Github

Step 6.5 (VSCODE): connect the local repository to the Github repository

type in terminal:
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git

Step 7: rename the local branch to main (to match Github’s default branch)

type in terminal:
git branch -M main

Step 8: Push the local repository into github repository

type in terminal:
git push -u origin main

Step 9: check the list of branches in the repository

type in terminal:
git branch

Step 10: create a new branch

type:
git branch branchname

Step 11: switch to the second branch

type:
git checkout branchname

Step 12: create a file in new branch and make edits to it

Step 13: stage the file's edits

type in terminal:
git add "directory/file-name.ext"

Step 14: commit the file's edits with a message

type in terminal:
git commit -m "message"

Step 15: push changes made on second branch to second branch in Github

type in terminal:
git push origin branchname

Step 16 (GITHUB.COM): create a pull request (PR) to request pulling changes from the second branch into the main branch

on Github.com, visit the repository's Pull Requests tab and press "New Pull Request"

after making the correct selection, click on "Create Pull Request"

add a title and description and Create

Step 17 (GITHUB.COM): press the button that merges the changes into the main branch

!!! Step 18: switch back to the main branch in VSCODE

type in terminal:
git checkout main

Step 19 (GITHUB.COM): Go to the branches tab and delete the secondary branch

Step 20: After deleting the branch on GitHub, you still need to delete the local copy on VSCODE

Delete the secondary branch
type in terminal:
git branch -d branchname

Step 20.5 (optional but recommended): clean up deleted remote branches locally

type in terminal:
git fetch --prune

Step 21: Warmup complete !
