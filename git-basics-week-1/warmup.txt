Basic warmup for VSCODE/Github workflow.

Step 1: check if you have Git:

press ctrl + j to open the terminal and type in "git --version"

Step 2: initialize a repository:

type "git init into the terminal"
-- there should be a "u" next to all of the files in the vscode directory, it means "untracked" --

Step 3: staging a file (to be committed):

type git add "directory/file-name.ext" 
-- there should be an "a" next to the targeted file in the vscode directory, meaning the file is added to the repository --

Step 4: check the git status
Type "git status" into the terminal to see whether things were staged/committed

Step 5: commit with a message 

Type into terminal: git commit -m "message"
-- the -m allows you to follow up the commit with a message to determine what changes were implemented --

Step 6 (GITHUB.COM): Create a repository in Github

Step 7: merge the local main branch into the Github main branch

type in terminal: "git branch -M main"

Step 8: Push the local repository into github repository

type in terminal: "git push -u origin main"

Step 9: check the list of branches in the repository

type in terminal: "git branch"

Step 9: create a branch

type: "git branch branchname"

Step 10: switch to the second branch

type: "git checkout branchname"

Step 11: create a file in new branch and make edits to it

Step 12 : push changes made on second branch to second branch in Github

type in terminal: "git push origin branchname"

Step 13 (GITHUB.COM): create a pull request (PR) to request pulling changes from the second branch into the main branch

on Github.com, visit the repository's Pull Requests tab and press "New Pull Request"

after making the correct selection, click on "Create Pull Request"

add a title and description and Create

Step 14 (GITHUB.COM): press the button that merges the changes into the main branch

Step 15 (GITHUB.COM): Go to the branches tab and delete the secondary branch

Step 16: After deleting the branch on GitHub, you still need to delete the local copy on VSCODE

1. switch to main branch
type in terminal: "git checkout main"

2. delete the secondary branch
type in terminal: "git branch -d branchname"

Step 17: Warmup complete !
