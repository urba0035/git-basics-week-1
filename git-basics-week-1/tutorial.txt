Git Basics Tutorial

Step 1: check if you have Git:

press ctrl + j to open the terminal and type in "git --version"

Step 2: initialize a repository:

type "git init into the terminal"
-- there should be a "u" next to all of the files in the vscode directory, it means "untracked" --

Step 3: staging a file (to be committed):

type git add "directory/file-name.ext" 
-- there should be an "a" next to the targeted file in the vscode directory, meaning the file is added to the repository --

Step 4: check the git status
Type "git status" into the terminal to see whether things were staged/committed

Step 4: commit with a message 

Type into terminal: git commit -m "message"
-- the -m allows you to follow up the commit with a message to determine what changes were implemented --

Step 5: Create a repository in Github and add your local repository into into it

type in terminal: "git branch -M main"

-- capital M means move/transfer --
-- Forces the rename, even if a branch called main already exists --
-- moves main -> main
-- the main on the left is the local main branch --
-- the main on the right is the github main branch --

Step 6: Push the repository into the main branch

type in terminal: "git push -u origin main"

Step 7: check the list of branches in the repository

Step 8: create a branch

type: "git branch branchname"

Step 9: switch to the second branch

type: "git checkout branchname"

Step 10 (optional for testing): Make an edit to one of the files and save it
